# project_shorter
This project extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, summarizes the content using Transformers, translates it to another language, and converts it into speech using gTTS. It also performs sentiment analysis to categorize and voice different tones of the text. Ideal for creating quick, multilingual audio summaries of video content.
